# Cumulative Reasoning


Cumulative Reasoning is an advanced prompting technique that builds on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable steps and progressively accumulating knowledge and insights. In this technique, the language model is guided to solve a problem by incrementally building up its understanding, with each step building on the previous ones. This allows for a more structured and thorough problem-solving process, especially for tasks that require multiple levels of reasoning or complex logical deductions.

```python
import outlines
from pydantic import BaseModel, conint

# Set up the model
model = outlines.models.transformers("WizardLM/WizardMath-7B-V1.1")
generator = outlines.generate.format(model, int)

# Define the problem
total_apples = 150

# Step 1: Calculate apples sold on Monday
prompt_monday = f"30% of {total_apples} = "
apples_sold_monday = generator(prompt_monday)

# Step 2: Calculate apples remaining after Monday
prompt_remaining_monday = f"{total_apples} - {apples_sold_monday} = "
apples_remaining_monday = generator(prompt_remaining_monday)

# Step 3: Calculate apples sold on Tuesday
prompt_tuesday = f"25% of {apples_remaining_monday} = "
apples_sold_tuesday = generator(prompt_tuesday)

# Step 4: Calculate final number of apples remaining
prompt_final = f"{apples_remaining_monday} - {apples_sold_tuesday} = "
apples_remaining = generator(prompt_final)

# Define a Pydantic model for the final result
class AppleInventory(BaseModel):
    initial_apples: conint(ge=0)
    sold_monday: conint(ge=0)
    sold_tuesday: conint(ge=0)
    remaining_apples: conint(ge=0)

# Create the final result
result = AppleInventory(
    initial_apples=total_apples,
    sold_monday=apples_sold_monday,
    sold_tuesday=apples_sold_tuesday,
    remaining_apples=apples_remaining
)

print(result)
