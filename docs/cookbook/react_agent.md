# ReAct Agent

This example shows how to use [outlines](https://dottxt-ai.github.io/outlines/) to build your own agent with open weights local models and structured outputs. It is inspired by the blog post [A simple Python implementation of the ReAct pattern for LLMs](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern) by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/).

The ReAct pattern (for Reason+Act) is described in the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). It's a pattern where you implement additional actions that an LLM can take - searching Wikipedia or running calculations for example - and then teach it how to request the execution of those actions, and then feed their results back into the LLM.

Additionally, we give the LLM the possibility of using a scratchpad described in the paper [Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00114) which improves the ability of LLMs to perform multi-step computations.

We use [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) using the [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) library. Outlines supports llama-cpp-python, but we need to install it ourselves:

```bash
pip install llama-cpp-python
```

We download the model weights by passing the name of the repository on the HuggingFace Hub, and the filenames (or glob pattern):
```python
import llama_cpp
import outlines

llm = llama_cpp.Llama(
    "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-GGUF",
    tokenizer=llama_cpp.llama_tokenizer.LlamaHFTokenizer.from_pretrained(
        "NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B"
    ),
    n_gpu_layers=-1,
    flash_attn=True,
    n_ctx=8192,
    verbose=False
)
model = outlines.from_llamacpp(llm)
```

??? note "(Optional) Store the model weights in a custom folder"

    By default the model weights are downloaded to the hub cache but if we want so store the weights in a custom folder, we pull a quantized GGUF model [Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Theta-Llama-3-8B-GGUF) by [NousResearch](https://nousresearch.com/) from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/):

    ```bash
    wget https://hf.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-GGUF/resolve/main/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf
    ```

    We initialize the model:

    ```python
    from llama_cpp import Llama

    llm = Llama("/path/to/model/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf", ...)
    ```

## Build a ReAct agent

In this example, we use two tools:

- wikipedia: \<search term\> - search Wikipedia and returns the snippet of the first result
- calculate: \<expression\> - evaluate an expression using Python's eval() function

```python
import httpx

def wikipedia(q):
    return httpx.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php", params={
        "action": "query",
        "list": "search",
        "srsearch": q,
        "format": "json"
    }).json()["query"]["search"][0]["snippet"]


def calculate(numexp):
    return eval(numexp)
```

We define the logic of the agent through a Pydantic class. First, we want the LLM to decide only between the two previously defined tools:

```python
from enum import Enum

class Action(str, Enum):
    wikipedia = "wikipedia"
    calculate = "calculate"
```

Our agent will loop through Thought and Action. We explicitly give the Action Input field so it doesn't forget to add the arguments of the Action. We also add a scratchpad (optional).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Reason_and_Act(BaseModel):
    Scratchpad: str = Field(..., description="Information from the Observation useful to answer the question")
    Thought: str = Field(..., description="It describes your thoughts about the question you have been asked")
    Action: Action
    Action_Input: str = Field(..., description="The arguments of the Action.")
```

Our agent will reach a Final Answer. We also add a scratchpad (optional).

```python
class Final_Answer(BaseModel):
    Scratchpad: str = Field(..., description="Information from the Observation useful to answer the question")
    Final_Answer: str = Field(..., description="Answer to the question grounded on the Observation")
```

Our agent will decide when it has reached a Final Answer and therefore to stop the loop of Thought and Action.

```python
from typing import Union

class Decision(BaseModel):
    Decision: Union[Reason_and_Act, Final_Answer]

json_schema = Decision.model_json_schema()
```

We then need to adapt our prompt to the [Hermes prompt format for JSON schema](https://github.com/NousResearch/Hermes-Function-Calling?tab=readme-ov-file#prompt-format-for-json-mode--structured-outputs) and explain the agent logic. We can load a template from a file for that:

```python
from outlines import Template

hermes_prompt = Template.from_file("prompt_templates/react_agent.txt")
```

We define a ChatBot class

```python
class ChatBot:
    def __init__(self, prompt=""):
        self.prompt = prompt

    def __call__(self, user_prompt):
        self.prompt += user_prompt
        result = self.execute()
        return result

    def execute(self):
        generator = outlines.Generator(model, Decision)
        result = generator(self.prompt, max_tokens=1024, temperature=0, seed=42)
        return result
```

We define a query function:

```python
import json

def query(question, max_turns=5):
    i = 0
    next_prompt = (
        "\n<|im_start|>user\n" + question + "<|im_end|>"
        "\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
    )
    previous_actions = []
    while i < max_turns:
        i += 1
        prompt = generate_hermes_prompt(
            question=question,
            schema=Decision.model_json_schema(),
            today=datetime.datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        )
        bot = ChatBot(prompt=prompt)
        result = bot(next_prompt)
        json_result = json.loads(result)['Decision']
        if "Final_Answer" not in list(json_result.keys()):
            scratchpad = json_result['Scratchpad'] if i == 0 else ""
            thought = json_result['Thought']
            action = json_result['Action']
            action_input = json_result['Action_Input']
            print(f"\x1b[34m Scratchpad: {scratchpad} \x1b[0m")
            print(f"\x1b[34m Thought: {thought} \x1b[0m")
            print(f"\x1b[36m  -- running {action}: {str(action_input)}\x1b[0m")
            if action + ": " + str(action_input) in previous_actions:
                observation = "You already run that action. **TRY A DIFFERENT ACTION INPUT.**"
            else:
                if action=="calculate":
                    try:
                        observation = eval(str(action_input))
                    except Exception as e:
                        observation = f"{e}"
                elif action=="wikipedia":
                    try:
                        observation = wikipedia(str(action_input))
                    except Exception as e:
                        observation = f"{e}"
            print()
            print(f"\x1b[33m Observation: {observation} \x1b[0m")
            print()
            previous_actions.append(action + ": " + str(action_input))
            next_prompt += (
                "\nScratchpad: " + scratchpad +
                "\nThought: " + thought +
                "\nAction: " + action  +
                "\nAction Input: " + action_input +
                "\nObservation: " + str(observation)
            )
        else:
            scratchpad = json_result["Scratchpad"]
            final_answer = json_result["Final_Answer"]
            print(f"\x1b[34m Scratchpad: {scratchpad} \x1b[0m")
            print(f"\x1b[34m Final Answer: {final_answer} \x1b[0m")
            return final_answer
    print(f"\nFinal Answer: I am sorry, but I am unable to answer your question. Please provide more information or a different question.")
    return "No answer found"
```

We can now test our ReAct agent:

```python
print(query("What's 2 to the power of 10?"))
# Scratchpad:
# Thought: I need to perform a mathematical calculation to find the result of 2 to the power of 10.
#  -- running calculate: 2**10
#
# Observation: 1024
#
# Scratchpad: 2 to the power of 10 is 1024.
# Final Answer: 2 to the power of 10 is 1024.
# 2 to the power of 10 is 1024.
```

```python
print(query("What does England share borders with?"))
# Scratchpad:
# Thought: To answer this question, I will use the 'wikipedia' action to gather information about England's geographical location and its borders.
#  -- running wikipedia: England borders
#
# Observation: Anglo-Scottish <span class="searchmatch">border</span> (Scottish Gaelic: Crìochan Anglo-Albannach) is an internal <span class="searchmatch">border</span> of the United Kingdom separating Scotland and <span class="searchmatch">England</span> which runs for
#
# Scratchpad: Anglo-Scottish border (Scottish Gaelic: Crìochan Anglo-Albannach) is an internal border of the United Kingdom separating Scotland and England which runs for
# Final Answer: England shares a border with Scotland.
# England shares a border with Scotland.
```

As mentioned in Simon's blog post, this is not a very robust implementation at all and there's a ton of room for improvement. But it is lovely how simple it is with a few lines of Python to make these extra capabilities available to the LLM. And now you can run it locally with an open weights LLM.
