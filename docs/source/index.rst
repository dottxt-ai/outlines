ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Outlines
======================

**Outlines** is a Python library to write reliable programs for interactions with generative models: language models, diffusers, multimodal models, classifiers, etc. It provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to make prompting easier, constrained text generation and is natively concurrent. It integrates well with the rest of the Python ecosystem: tools, vector stores, etc.

ðŸ‘€ Sneak Peek
-------------

A toy implementation of an agent (similar to BabyAGI or AutoGPT) with Outlines:

.. code:: python

   import outlines.text as text
   import outlines.models as models

   from my_tools import google_search, execute_code
   from my_response_models import command_response


   @outlines.prompt
   def agent_prompt(objective, goals, tools, response_model):
       """You are an AI with the following objective: {{ objective }}

       Keep the following goals in mind:
       {% for goal in goals %}
       {{ loop.counter }}. {{ goal }}
       {% endfor %}

       COMMANDS
       {% for tool in tools %}
       - {{ tool | name }}, {{ tool | description }}, {{ tool | signature }}
       {% endfor %}

       OUTPUT FORMAT
       {{ response_model | schema }}
       """


   @outlines.chain
   async def agent(objective, goals, tools)
      complete = models.text_completion.hf("sshleifer/tiny-gpt2")
      prompt = agent_prompt(objective, goals, tools , command_response)
      answer = await complete(prompt)
      command = command_response(answer)

      return command


   agent(
       "Write a library called Outlines",
       ["Easy prompting", "Multimodal, multimodel", "Constrained text generation"],
       [google_search, execute_code],
   )
