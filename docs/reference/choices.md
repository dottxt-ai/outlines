# Multiple choices

Choice between different options
In some cases we know the output is to be chosen between different options. We can restrict the completionâ€™s output to these choices using the is_in keyword argument:

```python
import outlines.models as models

complete = models.text_completion.openai("text-davinci-002")
answer = complete(
    "Pick the odd word out: skirt, dress, pen, jacket",
    is_in=["skirt", "dress", "pen", "jacket"]
)
```
