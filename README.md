## Installation

**Outlines** is available on PyPi:

``` bash
pip install outlines
```

The dependencies needed to use models are not installed by default. You will need to run:

- `pip install openai` to be able to use OpenAI [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).
- `pip install transformers datasets` to be able to use Hugging Face `transformers` [models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation).

## Philosophy

**Outlines** 〰 is a library for neural text generation. You can think of it as a
more flexible replacement for the `generate` method in the
[transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.

**Outlines** 〰 helps developers *guide text generation* to build robust
interfaces with external systems. Provides generation methods that
guarantee that the output will match a regular expressions, or follow
a JSON schema.

**Outlines** 〰 provides *robust prompting primitives* that separate the prompting
from the execution logic and lead to simple implementations of few-shot
generations, ReAct, meta-prompting, agents, etc.

**Outlines** 〰 is designed as a *library* that is meant to be compatible the
broader ecosystem, not to replace it. We use as few abstractions as possible,
and generation can be interleaved with control flow, conditionals, custom Python
functions and calls to other libraries.

**Outlines** 〰 is *compatible with all models*. It only interfaces with models
via the next-token logits. It can be used with API-based models as well.


## Guided generation

The first step towards reliability of systems that include large language models
is to ensure that there is a well-defined interface between their output and
user-defined code. **Outlines** provides ways to control the generation of
language models to make their output more predictable.

### Multiple choices

You can reduce the completion to a choice between multiple possibilities:

``` python
import outlines

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

prompt = """You are a sentiment-labelling assistant.
Is the following review positive or negative?

Review: This restaurant is just awesome!
"""
answer = outlines.generate.choice(model, ["Positive", "Negative"])(prompt)
```

### Type constraint

You can instruct the model to only return integers or floats:


``` python
import outlines

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

prompt = "1+1="
answer = outlines.generate.format(model, int)(prompt)

prompt = "sqrt(2)="
answer = outlines.generate.format(model, float)(prompt)
```

### Efficient regex-guided generation

Outlines also comes with fast regex-guided generation. In fact, the `choice`,
`integer` and `float` functions above all use regex-guided generation under the
hood:

``` python
import outlines

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

prompt = "Is 1+1=2? "
unguided = outlines.generate.text(model, max_tokens=30)(prompt)
guided = outlines.generate.regex(model, r"\s*([Yy]es|[Nn]o|[Nn]ever|[Aa]lways)", max_tokens=30)(
    prompt
)

print(unguided)
# Is 1+1=2?
#
# This is probably the most perplexing question.
# As I said in one of my articles describing how
# I call 2 and 1, there isn't

print(guided)
# Is 1+1=2? Always
```

``` python
import outlines

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

prompt = "What is the IP address of the Google DNS servers? "
unguided = outlines.generate.text(model, max_tokens=30)(prompt)
guided = outlines.generate.regex(
    model,
    r"((25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)",
    max_tokens=30,
)(prompt)

print(unguided)
# What is the IP address of the Google DNS servers?
#
# Passive DNS servers are at DNS servers that are private.
# In other words, both IP servers are private. The database
# does not contain Chelsea Manning

print(guided)
# What is the IP address of the Google DNS servers?
# 2.2.6.1
```

Unlike other libraries, regex-guided generation in Outlines is almost as fast
as non-guided generation.

### Efficient JSON generation following a Pydantic model

Outlines 〰 allows to guide the generation process so the output is *guaranteed* to follow a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) or [Pydantic model](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/):

```python
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel, constr

import outlines
import torch


class Weapon(str, Enum):
    sword = "sword"
    axe = "axe"
    mace = "mace"
    spear = "spear"
    bow = "bow"
    crossbow = "crossbow"


class Armor(str, Enum):
    leather = "leather"
    chainmail = "chainmail"
    plate = "plate"


class Character(BaseModel):
    name: constr(max_length=10)
    age: int
    armor: Armor
    weapon: Weapon
    strength: int


model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", device="cuda")

# Construct guided sequence generator
generator = outlines.generate.json(model, Character, max_tokens=100)

# Draw a sample
rng = torch.Generator(device="cuda")
rng.manual_seed(789001)

sequence = generator("Give me a character description", rng=rng)
print(sequence)
# {
#   "name": "clerame",
#   "age": 7,
#   "armor": "plate",
#   "weapon": "mace",
#   "strength": 4171
# }

sequence = generator("Give me an interesting character description", rng=rng)
print(sequence)
# {
#   "name": "piggyback",
#   "age": 23,
#   "armor": "chainmail",
#   "weapon": "sword",
#   "strength": 0
# }
```

The method works with union types, optional types, arrays, nested schemas, etc. Some field constraints are [not supported yet](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines/issues/215), but everything else should work.

### Efficient JSON generation following a JSON Schema

Sometimes you just want to be able to pass a JSON Schema instead of a Pydantic model. We've got you covered:

``` python
import outlines
import torch

schema = '''{
    "title": "Character",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "title": "Name",
            "maxLength": 10,
            "type": "string"
        },
        "age": {
            "title": "Age",
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "armor": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Armor"},
        "weapon": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Weapon"},
        "strength": {
            "title": "Strength",
            "type": "integer"
        }
    },
    "required": ["name", "age", "armor", "weapon", "strength"],
    "definitions": {
        "Armor": {
            "title": "Armor",
            "description": "An enumeration.",
            "enum": ["leather", "chainmail", "plate"],
            "type": "string"
        },
        "Weapon": {
            "title": "Weapon",
            "description": "An enumeration.",
            "enum": ["sword", "axe", "mace", "spear", "bow", "crossbow"],
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
}'''

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", device="cuda")
generator = outlines.generate.json(model, schema)
sequence = generator("Give me a character description")
```

### Using context-free grammars to guide generation

Formal grammars rule the world, and Outlines makes them rule LLMs too. You can pass any context-free grammar in the EBNF format and Outlines will generate an output that is valid to this grammar:

``` python
import outlines

arithmetic_grammar = """
    ?start: sum

    ?sum: product
        | sum "+" product   -> add
        | sum "-" product   -> sub

    ?product: atom
        | product "*" atom  -> mul
        | product "/" atom  -> div

    ?atom: NUMBER           -> number
         | "-" atom         -> neg
         | "(" sum ")"

    %import common.NUMBER
    %import common.WS_INLINE

    %ignore WS_INLINE
"""

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", device="cuda")
generator = outlines.generate.cfg(model, arithmetic_grammar)
sequence = generator("Write a formula that returns 5 using only additions and subtractions.")

# It looks like Mistral is not very good at arithmetics :)

print(sequence)
# 1+3-2-4+5-7+8-6+9-6+4-2+3+5-1+1
```

This was a very simple grammar, and you can use `outlines.generate.cfg` to generate syntactically valid Python, SQL, and much more than this. Any kind of structured text, really. All you have to do is search for "X EBNF grammar" on the web, and take a look at the [Outlines Grammars repository](https://github.com/outlines-dev/grammars).

### Open functions

Outlines can infer the structure of the output from the signature of a function. The result is a dictionary, and can be passed directly to the function using the usual dictionary expansion syntax `**`:

```python
import outlines


def add(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")
generator = outlines.generate.json(model, add)
result = generator("Return two integers named a and b respectively. a is odd and b even.")

print(add(**result))
# 3
```

A great advantage of passing functions directly to specify the structure is that the structure of the LLM will change with the function's definition. No need to change the code at several places!

## Prompting

Writing prompts by concatenating strings in pure Python quickly becomes
cumbersome: the prompt building logic gets entangled with the rest of the
program, and the structure of the rendered prompt is obfuscated.**Outlines**
makes it easier to write and manage prompts by encapsulating templates inside
"template functions".

These functions make it possible to neatly separate the prompt logic from the
general program logic; they can be imported from other modules and libraries.

Template functions require no superfluous abstraction, they use the Jinja2
templating engine to help build complex prompts in a concise manner:

``` python
import outlines

examples = [
    ("The food was digusting", "Negative"),
    ("We had a fantastic night", "Positive"),
    ("Recommended", "Positive"),
    ("The waiter was rude", "Negative")
]

@outlines.prompt
def labelling(to_label, examples):
    """You are a sentiment-labelling assistant.

    {% for example in examples %}
    {{ example[0] }} // {{ example[1] }}
    {% endfor %}
    {{ to_label }} //
    """

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")
prompt = labelling("Just awesome", examples)
answer = outlines.generate.text(model, max_tokens=100)(prompt)
```

### Tools

We can teach language models to call external functions to get additional
informations or perform tasks, by encoding the functions' description in the
prompt. To avoid duplicating information between the function definition and the
description passed to the prompt, we define custom Jinja filters that can
extract the function's name, description, signature and source:


``` python
from typing import Callable, List
import outlines


def google_search(query: str):
    """Google Search"""
    pass


def wikipedia_search(query: str):
    """Wikipedia Search"""
    pass


@outlines.prompt
def my_commands(tools: List[Callable]):
    """AVAILABLE COMMANDS:

    {% for tool in tools %}
    TOOL
    {{ tool | name }}, {{ tool | description }}, args: {{ tool | signature }}
    {{ tool | source }}
    {% endfor %}
    """


prompt = my_commands([google_search, wikipedia_search])
```

### Response models

We can instruct models to return their output in a pre-defined format, often
JSON. To avoid duplicating information between the function definition and the
description passed to the prompt we define a custom Jinja filter that can
extract the expected response's schema:

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import outlines


class Joke(BaseModel):
    joke: str = Field(description="The joke")
    explanation: str = Field(
        description="The explanation of why the joke is funny"
    )


@outlines.prompt
def joke_ppt(response_model):
    """Tell a joke and explain why the joke is funny.

    RESPONSE FORMAT:
    {{ response_model | schema }}
    """


joke_ppt(Joke)

# Tell a joke and explain why the joke is funny.
#
# RESPONSE FORMAT:
# {
#    "joke": "The joke"
#    "explanation": "The explanation of why the joke is funny"
#  }
```

With these prompting primitives **Outlines** makes building agents like
[AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT),
[BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi),
[ViperGPT](https://viper.cs.columbia.edu/) or [Transformers
Agent](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents) easier by
removing boilerplate prompting code.
